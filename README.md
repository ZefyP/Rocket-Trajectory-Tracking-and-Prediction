# Rocket Trajectory Tracking and Prediction

This repository contains code to predict the trajectory of a rocket. It implements an algorithm to determine the predicted trajectory and range of a rocket, taking into account various factors, such as speed, acceleration, and wind.


# Features

- Imports a Cd curve from an external file
- Accounts for different wind profiles and gusts of wind.

# Usage
The code is organised into several modules, including:
- `rocket.py`: contains the Rocket class, which is used to create and manage a rocket instance.
-  `drag.py`: contains the 
- `trajectory_generator.py`: contains the Trajectory class, which is used to model the rocket's behaviour.

In addition it contains sample data files using real launch data obtained from launches of team Sunride from the University of Sheffield.
