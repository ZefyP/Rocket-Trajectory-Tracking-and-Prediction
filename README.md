# Rocket Trajectory Tracking and Prediction

This repository contains code to predict the trajectory of a rocket. It implements an algorithm to determine the predicted trajectory and range of a rocket, as well as a viaerty of flight performance metrics as well as taking into account various factors, such as speed, acceleration, and wind profile at the location of launch.

## Software Architecture

The software architecture of the rocket trajectory tracking and prediction project can be represented as follows:

# Usage
The code is organised into several modules, including:
The `trajectory_generator` directory contains the files specific to the trajectory generation module of the project. These files are encapsulated within the directory and include:

- `rocket.py`: Defines the Rocket class and its properties.
- `stage.py`: Implements stages of the rocket and related calculations.
- `drag.py`: Contains calculations and models related to drag forces.
- `flight_data.py`: Handles flight data and related operations.
- `launchsite.py`: Defines the launch site information and calculations.
- `parachute.py`: Contains parachute-related functionality.
- `wind.py`: Handles wind profile data and calculations.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions used in the module.

- `setup.py`: Configuration and setup details for the trajectory generation 
- `atmosphere.py`: Provides functionality related to atmospheric conditions.
- `baro_plot.py`: Implements plotting functions for barometric data.
- `constants.py`: Defines constants used throughout the module.module.
- `tests.py`: Contains tests for verifying the functionality of the module.
- `tr2_output.kml`: Output file in KML format for visualizing the rocket trajectory.

- `output/`: Directory to store output files generated during trajectory generation.
- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the module.
- `__pycache__/`: Directory to store cached files generated by Python.

These files work together to generate and predict the trajectory of the rocket based on the given inputs and conditions.

Note: The encapsulation is represented in a markdown format for better readability and understanding.

In addition it contains sample data files using real launch data obtained from launches of team Sunride from the University of Sheffield.

To get started with the Rocket Trajectory Tracking and Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/ZefyP/Rocket-Trajectory-Tracking-and-Prediction.git ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Explore the various modules and files within the repository to understand the code structure and functionality. 
4. Run the example file for Karman Mini launch 2 to demonstrate the tool. 
5. Use the provided sample data or incorporate your own launch data into the project.
6. In the basis of that, create your own scrip and experiment with different scenarios to track and predict rocket trajectories.
