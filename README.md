# Rocket Trajectory Tracking and Prediction

This repository contains code to track and predict the trajectory of a rocket. It implements a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal trajectory of the rocket, taking into account various factors, such as speed, acceleration, and wind.

The code is written in Python and can be used to simulate a rocket's flight path. The repository includes a demo program to demonstrate the tracking and prediction of a rocket's trajectory.

The code is organized into several modules, including:
- `Rocket.py`: contains the Rocket class, which is used to create and manage a rocket instance.
- `Trajectory.py`: contains the Trajectory class, which is used to track and predict the rocket's trajectory.
- `Simulator.py`: contains the Simulator class, which is used to simulate the rocket's flight path.

In addition, the repository contains sample data files and a documentation file.


# Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code in this repository:

* pyqt5
* numpy
* matplotlib

To install these packages, run the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

These are the packages are required to run the code in the repository. The pip install command can be used to install all of these packages at once by specifying the requirements file (requirements.txt). This makes it easier to set up the necessary software environment for running the code.
