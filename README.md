# Rocket Trajectory Tracking and Prediction

This repository contains code to track and predict the trajectory of a rocket. It implements a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal trajectory of the rocket, taking into account various factors, such as speed, acceleration, and wind.

The code is written in Python and can be used to simulate a rocket's flight path. The repository includes a demo program to demonstrate the tracking and prediction of a rocket's trajectory.

The code is organized into several modules, including:
- `Rocket.py`: contains the Rocket class, which is used to create and manage a rocket instance.
- `Trajectory_generator.py`: contains the Trajectory class, which is used to track and predict the rocket's trajectory.

In addition, the repository contains sample data files and a documentation file.
