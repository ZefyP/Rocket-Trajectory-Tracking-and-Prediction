 Imports the "Stage" class from another module in the same package and uses it as an argument for the function. 
 The function returns the drag coefficient for the given Mach number based on a set of conditional statements. 
 The data is derived from a reference source, Sutton's "Rocket Propulsion Elements", 7th edition, page 108.
